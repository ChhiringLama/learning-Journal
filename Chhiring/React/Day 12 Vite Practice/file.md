Tried to make a small static project with vite.

Revisied setting up common setup packages like 
react-router-dom
eslint 
eslint-create-app
vite-plugin-eslint

Revisied on setting up routes with BrowserRouter, Routes and Route
Understood basic idea of setting up App.jsx as a place to route the pages (Considered components in SPA) and load them into the browser without
needing to do a complete refresh of the page.
